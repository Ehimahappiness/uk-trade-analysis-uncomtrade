# uk-trade-analysis-uncomtrade
End-to-end data analysis of the UK’s milk and cream trade using UN Comtrade data, demonstrating data cleaning, aggregation, trade analysis, and insight generation with Python and pandas.

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis of the United Kingdom’s
milk and cream trade (HS code 0402) using data from the United Nations Comtrade
database. The analysis focuses on imports and exports between January and May
2015, with additional monthly trend exploration.

The project demonstrates skills in data sourcing, cleaning, aggregation,
analysis, and interpretation using Python and pandas.

## Objectives
- Determine whether the UK is a net importer or exporter of milk and cream
- Identify key trading partners for imports and exports
- Analyse trade concentration and dependence on regular customers
- Explore monthly patterns and potential seasonality
- Assess data quality issues in international trade reporting

---

## Key Insights
- The UK recorded a trade surplus of over 100 million USD during the period
- Ireland was the UK’s most significant trading partner, importing nearly
  three times more milk and cream from the UK than it exported back
- The UK exported to over 100 countries but imported from only 21
- Sixteen regular customers accounted for approximately 75% of export value
- Some bi-directional trade flows appear economically insignificant,
  raising data reliability questions
